**CAPI Flash Block Layer API**

**1.1 cblk\_init**

***Purpose***

Initializes CAPI block library

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

int rc = cblk\_int(void \*arg, int flags)

***Parameters***

|               |                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter** | **Description**                                         |
| arg           | Currently unused (set to NULL)                          |
| flags         | Specifies flags for initialization. Currently set to 0. |

***Description***

The cblk\_init API initializes the CAPI block library prior to use. cblk\_init must be called before any other API in the library is called.

***Return Values***

Returns 0 on success; otherwise it is an error.

**1.2 cblk\_term**

***Purpose***

Cleans up CAPI block library resources after the library is no longer used.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

int rc = cblk\_term(void \*arg, int flags)

***Parameters***

|               |                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter** | **Description**                                         |
| arg           | Currently unused (set to NULL)                          |
| flags         | Specifies flags for initialization. Currently set to 0. |

***Description***

The cblk\_term API terminates the CAPI block library after use.

***Return Values***

Returns 0 on success; otherwise it is an error.

**1.3 cblk\_open**

***Purpose***

Open a collection of contiguous blocks (currently called a “chunk”) on a CAPI flash storage device. for which I/O (read and writes) can be done. A chunk can be thought of as a lun, which the provides access to sectors 0 thru n-1 (where n is the size of the chunk in sectors). If virtual luns are specified then that chunk is a subset of sectors on a physical lun.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

chunk\_id\_t chunk\_id = cblk\_open(const char \*path, int max\_num\_requests, int mode, uint64\_t ext\_arg, int flags)

| flags              | This is a collection of bit flags. The **CBLK\_OPN\_VIRT\_LUN** indicates a virtual lun on the one physical lun will be provisioned. If the **CBLK\_OPN\_VIRT\_LUN** is not specified, then direct access to the full physical lun will be provided. The **CBLK\_OPN\_VIRT\_LUN** flag must be set for Redis shards. The **CBLK\_OPN\_NO\_INTRP\_THREADS** flag indicates that the cflash block library will not start any back ground threads for processing/harvesting of asynchronous completions from the CAPI adapter. Instead the process using this library must either call cblk\_aresult, or cblk\_listio library calls to poll for I/O completions. The **CBLK\_OPN\_MPIO\_FO** flag (valid for only AIX) indicates that the cflash block library will use Multi-path I/O failover (i.e. one path will be used for all I/O unless path specific errors are encountered, in which case an alternate path will be used if available. To determine the paths for a CAPI flash disk, use the command lspath -l hdiskN). The **CBLK\_OPN\_RESERVE** flag (valid for only AIX) indicates the cflash block library will use the “reserve policy” attribute associated with the disk in terms of establishing disk reservations. The **CBLK\_OPN\_RESERVE** flag can not be used in conjunction with the **CBLK\_OPN\_MPIO\_FO.** The **CBLK\_OPN\_FORCED\_RESERVE** flag (valid for only AIX) has the same behavior as the **CBLK\_OPEN\_RESERVE** flag with the one addition, that when the device is opened it will break any outstanding disk reservations on the first open of this disk. The **CBLK\_OPN\_FORCED\_RESERVE** flag can not be used in conjunction with the **CBLK\_OPN\_MPIO\_FO.** |

***Description***

The cblk\_open API creates a “chunk” of blocks on a CAPI flash lun. This chunk will be used for I/O (cblk\_read/cblk\_write) requests. The returned chunk\_id is assigned to a specific path via a specific adapter transparently to the caller. The underlying physical sectors used by a chunk will not be directly visible to users of the block layer.

Upon successful completion, a chunk id representing the newly created chunk instance is returned to the caller to be used for future API calls.

***Return Values***

Returns NULL\_CHUNK\_ID on error; otherwise it is a chunk\_id handle.

**1.4 cblk\_close**

***Purpose***

Closes a collection of contiguous blocks (called a “chunk”) on a CAPI flash storage device. for which I/O (read and writes) can be done.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

int rc = cblk\_close(chunk\_id\_t chunk\_id, int flags)

***Description***

This service releases the blocks associated with a chunk to be reused by others. Prior to them being reused by others the data blocks will need to be “scrubbed” to remove user data if the **CBLK\_SCRUB\_DATA\_FLG** is set.

| flags         | This is a collection of bit flags. The **CBLK\_SCRUB\_DATA\_FLG**indicates data blocks should be scrubbed before they can be reused by others,which is only valid for virtual luns (chunks opened with **CBLK\_OPN\_VIRT\_LUN** flag). |

***Return Values***

Returns 0 on success; otherwise it is an error.

**1.5 cblk\_get\_lun\_size**

***Purpose***

Returns the “size” (number of blocks) of the physical lun to which this chunk is associated. This call is not valid for a virtual lun.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

int rc = cblk\_get\_lun\_size(chunk\_id\_t chunk\_id, size\_t \*size, int flags)

***Description***

This service returns the number of blocks of the physical lun associated with this chunk. The cblk\_get\_lun\_size service requires one has done a cblk\_open to receive a valid chunk\_id.

***Parameters***

**1.6 cblk\_get\_size**

***Purpose***

Returns the “size” (number of blocks) assigned to a specific (virtual lun) chunk id, which is a virtual lun (i.e. the cblk\_open call that returned this id, had the **CBLK\_OPN\_VIRT\_LUN** flag). This service is not valid for physical luns.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

int rc = cblk\_get\_size(chunk\_id\_t chunk\_id, size\_t \*size, int flags)

***Description***

This service returns the number of blocks allocated to this chunk. The cblk\_get\_size service requires one has done a cblk\_open to receive a valid chunk\_id.

***Parameters***

|               |                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

| chunk\_id     | The handle for the chunk whose size is about to be changed. |
| size          | Number of 4K block to be used for this chunk.               |
| flags         | This is a collection of bit flags.                          |

***Return Values***

Returns 0 on success; otherwise it is error.

**1.7 cblk\_set\_size**

***Purpose***

Assign “size” blocks to a specific chunk id which is a virtual lun (i.e. the cblk\_open call that returned this id, had the **CBLK\_OPN\_VIRT\_LUN** flag). If blocks are already assigned to this chunk id, then one can increase/decrease the size by specifying a larger/smaller size, respectively. This service is not valid for physical luns.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

int rc = cblk\_set\_size(chunk\_id\_t chunk\_id, size\_t size, int flags)

***Description***

This service allocates “size” blocks to this chunk. The cblk\_set\_size call must be done prior to any cblk\_read or cblk\_write calls to this chunk. The cblk\_set\_size service requires one has done a cblk\_open to receive a valid chunk\_id.

If there were blocks originally assigned to this chunk and they are not being reused after cblk\_set\_size allocates the new blocks and the CBLK\_SCRUB\_DATA\_FLG is set in the flags parameter, then those originally blocks will be “scrubbed” prior to allowing them to be reused by other cblk\_set\_size operations.

Upon successful completion, the chunk will has LBAs 0 thru size – 1 that can be read/written.

**1.14 cblk\_clone\_after\_fork**

***Purpose***

Allows a child process to access the same virtual lun as the parent process. The child process must do this operation immediately after the fork, using the parent's chunk id in order to access that storage. If the child does not do this operation then it will not have any access to the parent's chunk ids. This service is not valid for physical luns. This is service is only valid for linux.

***Syntax***

\#include &lt;capiblock.h&gt; for linux or &lt;sys/capiblock.h&gt; for AIX

rc = cblk\_clone\_after\_fork(chunk\_id\_t chunk\_id, int mode, int flags);

***Description***

This service allows a child process to access data from the parents process.

***Description***

This service provides an interface to issue multiple I/O requests with one call and/or poll for completions of multiple I/O requests via one call. The individual requests are specified by the **cblk\_io\_t** type, which includes a chunk id, data buffer, starting Logical Block Address, a transfer size in 4K blocks. This service can update the I/O requests associated cblk\_io\_t (i.e. update status, tags and flags based on disposition of the I/O request).

This service can not be used to check for completion on I/O requests issued via cblk\_aread or cblk\_awrite.
